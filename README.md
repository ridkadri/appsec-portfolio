# Application Security Portfolio – AppSec & GRC Focus

## Overview

This repository documents my structured learning and applied thinking in **Application Security (AppSec)** with a strong **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** perspective.

The focus of this portfolio is not exploit development, but understanding:

- How real-world web applications fail
- How attackers abuse normal application features
- How security controls should be designed, enforced, and governed

The analysis is grounded in widely used production platforms, particularly **Laravel** and **WordPress**, to reflect realistic enterprise environments.

## Portfolio Structure

### Week 1 – Applied AppSec Thinking (OWASP Top 10)

**Artifact:**

**How Web Applications Fail: An OWASP Top 10 Analysis Using Laravel and WordPress**

This write-up analyzes two high-impact OWASP Top 10 risks:

- **Broken Access Control (A01)**
- **Injection (A03)**

Using Laravel and WordPress as case study contexts, the artifact explains:

- Where these vulnerabilities typically appear
- How attackers abuse design and control weaknesses
- The potential security and business impact
- High-level defensive and governance controls

## Learning Approach

My approach combines:

- OWASP Top 10 as a threat modeling framework
- Platform-specific security considerations
- Risk-based and control-focused thinking aligned with GRC principles

Hands-on labs and testing environments (e.g. WebGoat, Juice Shop) are introduced later to validate and reinforce this foundational analysis.

## Scope and Disclaimer

This repository:

- Does **not** contain exploits against live or production systems
- Is intended for **educational and defensive security purposes**
- Reflects analysis of common design and implementation risks

## About Me

I work with **Laravel and WordPress** in production environments and am transitioning deeper into **Application Security**, with long-term interest in **GRC, risk assessment, and secure system design**.

This repository represents an evolving portfolio as I progress through structured AppSec learning and practical validation.
